# VehicalSpeedDetectionUsingYoloandOpenCv
Developed a real-time vehicle speed detection system
using YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for motion tracking. The system accurately estimates vehicle
speeds by integrating calibrated reference distances, ensuring precision in real-world scenarios. A Tkinterbased GUI was designed to provide live visualization of vehicle movement, along with dynamic updates on
speed and traffic statistics. The system tracks vehicle types, counts, and speeds, offering comprehensive realtime traffic monitoring capabilities. By leveraging Python, NumPy, and advanced computer vision techniques,
the solution is both efficient and robust. The project focuses on optimizing detection and tracking
performance, enabling smooth operation in diverse traffic conditions. It incorporates scalable components
suitable for deployment in intelligent transportation systems. Additionally, the system includes features for
statistical analysis to provide actionable insights into traffic patterns. This work demonstrates the practical
application of machine learning and computer vision in addressing real-world challenges. The result is a
reliable tool for traffic monitoring and management
